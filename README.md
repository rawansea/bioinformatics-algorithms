# Bioinformatics Algorithms

This repository contains a curated collection of bioinformatics algorithms implemented in **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**. These algorithms are foundational tools used in computational biology and genomics research.

## üìÅ Project Structure

| File/Folder Name           | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `FrequentWord.py`         | Finds the most frequent k-mers in a given DNA string. |
| `Genome_Assembly.py`      | Implements basic genome assembly techniques. |
| `GreedyMotifSearch.py`    | Finds motifs in a collection of DNA sequences using the Greedy Motif Search algorithm. |
| `MonteCarlo.py`           | RandomizedSearch using Monte Carlo optimization for finding motifs. |
| `profile_most_probable_kmer.py` | Identifies the most probable k-mer based on a given profile matrix. |
| `skew.ipynb`              | Jupyter notebook to analyze the GC skew in a DNA sequence. |
| `withmismatch.py`         | Finds approximate pattern matches allowing for mismatches. |
| `dataset_1.txt` / `dataset_2.txt` | Example datasets used by the algorithms. |
